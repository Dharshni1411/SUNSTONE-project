# Full Stack Development - Development of a E-Commerce website 

**ABSTRACT**

According to FAO’s latest report on The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI), the number of people affected by hunger rose
to as much as 828 million in 2021, an increase of about 46 million since 2020 and 150 million since 2019. In all, an estimated 3.1 billion people do
not have access to a healthy diet. Meanwhile, according to FAO’s State of Food and Agriculture (2019) report, around 14 percent of the world's food (valued at $400 billion per year) continues to be lost after it is harvested and before it reaches the shops; while UNEP’s Food Waste Index Report shows that a further 17
percent of our food ends up being wasted in retail and by consumers, particularly in households. According to FAO estimates, the food that is lost
and wasted could feed 1.26 billion hungry people every year. Food loss and waste (FLW) also account for 8-10 percent of global greenhouse gas
emissions (GHGs), contributing to an unstable climate and extreme weather events such as droughts and flooding. These changes negatively
impact crop yields, potentially reduce the nutritional quality of crops and cause supply chain disruption.Thus we came up with an idea to create a website in which the farmers/restaurants and (companies or organizations/individuals) who require those products can contact each other.
